## Text formatting
For the rich text element, you can use that to make complexe text.  
It's in the vanilla game so maybe I miss some.  
If you put that in you text, the text that follow it will change.  
Check example in `media/lua/shared/Translate`  
```
- <LEFT>, <RIGHT>, <CENTER>: Position.
- <SIZE:font>: Font.
- <H1>, <H2>, <TEXT>: To make title, start with h1 or h2, text to back to normal text.
- <IMAGECENTER:media/ui/myFolder/myImage.png>: Add an image to the text.
- <LINE>: New line
- <BR>: Jump line (Not sure what it does compare to <LINE>)
```
